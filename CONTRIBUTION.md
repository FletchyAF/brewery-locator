Your pull requests are not guaranteed to be implemented, but will be considered always.

The following factor in to how I view your pull request:

The intentions of your pull request should be obvious, and should detail
what feature you are trying to add or fix.

### High Quality

  - Free of improper spelling and punctuation
  - It reads well

### Repo Vision

The aim of this repository is:

  - To help me pass my first phase at coding bootcamp
  - To create a small application that is fun to tinker with on a personal level
  - Be a program that uses the ruby programming language in order to reference an API
  of breweries across the United States of America and give a filtered list of breweries
  based off of prompted user input
