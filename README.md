# brewery-locator

brewery-locator is a simple ruby application that takes user input and outputs a list of breweries near the
location selected by the user. The user is initially prompted for a filter, the filter being either a State,
a City, a Zip-code, or they can choose the final option to close the program. After selecting a filter the user
is asked to type in the state, city or zip-code of their choosing based off their filter. The program then finds the 
breweries in that area!
